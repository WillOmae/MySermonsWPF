# MySermonsWPF
_Your Bible study partner for recording, storing and viewing notes._

MySermons is your Bible study companion. It is designed to enable the easy creation, storage and maintenance of sermons and Bible studies (and anything else of similar intent).

This is a rebuilding from the ground up of MySermons. It corrects issues inherent in the previous work due to the erratic nature of its development. Furthermore, it departs from the WinForms GUI framework used in the previous work, making use of the Windows Presentation Foundation GUI framework.
